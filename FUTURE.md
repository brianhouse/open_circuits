## plan

RESPONSIVE OBJECT
- Python programming on the ESP with Thonny
- input sensors: range (presence), sound, capacitance (touch), photocells
- Neopixels (light) limits
- Piezos (sound)

INSTRUMENT
- input interface: switches, knobs, buttons how many
- touch 2?
- acceleration and orientation
- laser cutting

ENTANGLERS
- networking
- Servos (movement) how?
- soldering and prototyping?

(if instrument gets off-loaded to its own course, need a third. )


## tech

if we use V2, could use this to boost volume:

(can only use V2 if micropython + servo breakout is compatible)



## future

design thinking? there's tons of pedagogical content around the issues I'm bringing up here that I am leaving by the wayside, or leaving to intuition.
