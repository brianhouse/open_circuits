## tech

be aware of and check for the pin 20 issue in Micropython
https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/8440
once that's fixed, could uprade controllers to v2



## plan

RESPONSIVE OBJECT
- Python programming on the ESP with Thonny
- input sensors: range (presence), sound, capacitance (touch), photocells
- Neopixels (light) limits
- Piezos (sound)

INSTRUMENT
- input interface: switches, knobs, buttons, touch
- acceleration and orientation
- laser cutting

ENTANGLERS
- networking
- Servos (movement) how?
- soldering and prototyping?

(if Instrument gets off-loaded to its own course, need a third project)



## future

design thinking? there's tons of pedagogical content around the issues I'm bringing up here that I am leaving by the wayside, or leaving to intuition.
