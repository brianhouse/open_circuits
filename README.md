## Course Description
Introduction to basic electronics and microcontrollers for studio artists. Students will program chips to control sensors, switches, motors, and lights to create responsive objects and performative tools. Critical discussion will situate our circuits in histories of interactive art, electronics-based and otherwise. Students will create studio-based art for critique. No prior experience with electronics or programming is required, but ARHA 278: Art + Code is recommended.

#### Objectives:
- Cultivate an ability to think in terms of systems that span the physical and the digital
- Develop a repertoire of electronics techniques for studio practice
- Understand the ways in which sensor technology participates in contemporary culture
- Survey contemporary artists working critically with physical computing


## Coursework and Evaluation

### Projects
This course is built around three projects completed over the course of the semester, which will be [critiqued by the class](https://github.com/brianhouse/open_circuits/blob/master/resources/crit_guidelines.md). While there are technical and conceptual parameters for each project, you are expected to experiment and to develop a personal artistic trajectory. Prior to each project, a proposal is due, which will be discussed in class. Completed projects must have a title and [3-sentence description](https://github.com/brianhouse/open_circuits/blob/master/resources/description_guidelines.md), which must be turned in via Moodle along with a documentation video. As work is evaluated via in-class crit, no late work can be accepted.


### Workshops
Over the course of the semester, there will be many hands-on workshops in class. These workshops provide a material understanding of the subject matter and establish the technical skills that you will apply to your projects. Each will include an exercise to be completed.

### Survey presentations
Over the course of the semester, each student will give **TWO** 10-minute presentations on an influential work of media art as listed in the syllabus. These presentations, which must be organized in 5–10 slides (Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint, etc), should give a quick overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show the piece, explain how it works, and discuss its influence. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices and conclude with a few questions to kick off a brief conversation. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u-zuOeo9osRbM8WJ1LqEMxA-a1uRpD4oVfG5W-4zi5o/edit?usp=sharing) on an artwork chosen from [a list](resources/artworks.md) on an artwork on a first-come, first-served basis. Slides should be turned in on Moodle prior to class.

For assistance developing presentation skills, students should reach out to [Susan Daniels](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/support/writingcenter/public-speaking) at the Writing Center.

### Reading
Many classes will include discussion of short texts that situate technology in society. Reading is due on the day where the text is listed; a reading response must be submitted before class via Moodle. This can be a question raised by the text, a critique of it, a link to related artistic work, or some other brief comment which can stimulate our discussion.

### Participation
Attending all class sessions is mandatory, and motivated and mindful participation in crit and classroom discussion is expected.

### Grading
In this course, you are expected to earnestly engage in the practice of studio artmaking, and doing so is the basis of your grade at the discretion of the professor. In other words, your grade is about process, not about product—use the assignments and class sessions as opportunities for studio _practice_ (and completing all work on time and participating in class is mandatory). Beyond grades, your work will be evaluated subjectively via peer critique and feedback from the instructor, and you are expected to incorporate that feedback into your future work while pursuing your own creative direction. Midway through the semester, students will meet individually with the professor to track their progress.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Access to 303 and Working Together
While all students must complete their own work, you are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are also able to work in Fayerweather 303 outside of class hours. While 303 will be open any time class is not being held, we will also choose designated co-working time in the first week to encourage synchrony. Keys to 303 will be distributed to all students after Add/Drop. In addition, there is a forum on Moodle for students to post questions for each other.

### Technology
This course requires a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred (Windows and Linux are also fine; Chromebooks will not work). If you do not have access to a laptop, you will need to make arrangements to borrow one for the course. It is expected that you will not use your laptop for other purposes while in class. The use of phones in class is not permitted.

### Accommodations
I strive to make this course welcoming to all students. If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, you will need to register with [Accessibility Services](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/accessibility-services) for coordination of your academic accommodations. Once you have your accommodations in place, I will be glad to meet with you to discuss the best implementation of your accommodations.

### Honor Code and Academic Integrity
By enrolling in the course, you agree to uphold the principles set forth in the College’s [Honor Code](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism), including the Statement of Intellectual Responsibility, the Statement of Respect for Persons, and the Statement of Freedom of Expression and Dissent. The work submitted in this course must be conceived of and programmed by you. While learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)), you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' code wholesale. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
Our college is named after a white colonizer and is built in the Kwinitekw Valley on Nonotuck land; we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon indigenous peoples. As artists working with technology, we must be aware of and resist the many ways it capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
