# ARHA 294: OPEN CIRCUITS

Monday / Wednesday 1:00–3:00  
Fayerweather 303   

Prof. Brian House (he/him)

Office hours Tuesday 11:00–11:45  
Fayerweather 306


## Course Description
Introduction to basic electronics and microcontrollers for studio artists. Students will program chips to control sensors, switches, motors, and lights to create responsive objects and performative tools. Readings and critical discussion will situate our circuits in histories of interactive art, electronics-based and otherwise. Students will create studio-based art for critique. No prior experience with electronics or programming is required, but ARHA 278: Art + Code is recommended.

#### Objectives:
- Cultivate an ability to think in terms of systems that span the physical and the digital
- Develop a repertoire of electronics techniques for studio practice
- Understand the ways in which sensor technology participates in contemporary culture
- Survey contemporary artists working critically with physical computing


## Assignments and Grading

### Projects
This course is built around four projects completed over the course of the semester, which will be [critiqued by the class](https://github.com/brianhouse/open_circuits/blob/master/resources/crit_guidelines.md). While there are technical and conceptual parameters for each project, you are expected to experiment and to develop a personal artistic trajectory. A title and [3-sentence description](https://github.com/brianhouse/open_circuits/blob/master/resources/description_guidelines.md) must be included with each project. As work is evaluated via in-class crit, no late work can be accepted.

### Workshops
Over the course of the semester, there will be many hands-on workshops in class. These workshops are the basis for learning the technical skills you will apply to your projects. Each will include an exercise to be completed.

### Survey presentations
Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on an artist working with electronics. These presentations, which must be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show one or two artworks in detail. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. The presentation should end with a couple of questions posed to the class for discussion that relate to the technique or themes of the artist's work. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHoVP1O-VfYFJsBo8tri8cBQmJLKuMkgraGmMaQAIxU/edit?usp=sharing) on an artist chosen from [a list](resources/artists.md) on a first-come, first-served basis. 

<!-- ### Reading
Each week we will read critical texts that situate technology in society. Reading is due on the day where the text is listed; a reading response must be submitted before class via Moodle. This can be a question raised by the text, a critique of it, a link to related artistic work, or some other brief comment which can stimulate our discussion. -->

### Grading
In this course, you are expected to earnestly engage in the practice of studio artmaking, and doing so is the basis of your grade at the discretion of the professor. In other words, your grade is about process, not about product. Completing all work on time and participating in class is the baseline standard. Beyond that, your work will be evaluated subjectively via peer critique and feedback from the instructor, and you are expected to incorporate that feedback into your future work while pursuing your own creative impulses. Midway through the semester, students will meet individually with the professor to track their progress.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Access to 303
While all students must complete their own work, you are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are also able to work in Fayerweather 303 outside of class hours. We will choose designated open studios in the first week. Keys to 303 will be distributed to all students.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Technology
This course requires a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred (Windows and Linux are also fine; Chromebooks will not work). If you do not have access to a laptop, you will need to make arrangements to borrow one for the course. It is expected that you will not use your laptop for other purposes while in class. The use of phones in class is not permitted.

### Accommodations
I strive to make this course welcoming to all students. If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, you will need to register with [Accessibility Services](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/accessibility-services) for coordination of your academic accommodations. Once you have your accommodations in place, I will be glad to meet with you to discuss the best implementation of your accommodations.

### Honor Code and Academic Integrity
By enrolling in the course, you agree to uphold the principles set forth in the College’s [Honor Code](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism), including the Statement of Intellectual Responsibility, the Statement of Respect for Persons, and the Statement of Freedom of Expression and Dissent. The work submitted in this course must be conceived of and programmed by you. While learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org)), you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' code wholesale. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
Our college is named after a white colonizer and is built in the Kwinitekw Valley on Nonotuck land; we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon indigenous peoples. As artists working with technology, we must be aware of and resist the many ways computation capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
