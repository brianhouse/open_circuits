# TODO


## need

magnets
capacitive pads
very short rail jumpers
photocells
phone tripods

more esp32s for entanglement?



//



## tasks

- moodle

- can I do a meeting during exam week?

- artist project list, signups

/

- write an introduction class



## midterm

List of awesome pcomp projects, I talk about the ones that they don't do. 

What does a midterm meeting consist of?
- 10 mins with each student, talking about their experience and my expectations, "If you can do X, you'll get an A"


## plan

RESPONSIVE OBJECT
- Python programming on the ESP with Thonny
- input sensors: range (presence), sound, capacitance (touch), photocells
- Neopixels (light) limits
- Piezos (sound)

INSTRUMENT
- input interface: switches, knobs, buttons how many
- touch 2?
- acceleration and orientation
- laser cutting

ENTANGLERS
- networking
- Servos (movement) how?
- soldering and prototyping?




left out temperature, FSRs, and light level. FSRs are a pain and barely work. light level is fine, right? temperature is fine but not that responsive and kind of pointless?

## future

design thinking? there's tons of pedagogical content around the issues I'm bringing up here that I am leaving by the wayside, or leaving to intuition.
