## plan

What is this class?
- build off of ART212 at LC
- point toward Sound Art

Every week is a workshop with an exercise due, and over the course of the semester there are 4 projects.

There are readings, and there are artist presentations. Maybe two each, given the small class size.

No grades, midterm review.

technical issues:
