# TODO

- tell everyone to bring their laptops!

- prep ESPs
- capacitive pads -- test tin foil
- 100 ohm resistors -- have?

--> instrument unit is weak

- guide (Zac's suggestions! and additions!)


## midterm

What does a midterm meeting consist of?
- 10 mins with each student, talking about their experience and my expectations, "If you can do X, you'll get an A"


## plan

RESPONSIVE OBJECT
- Python programming on the ESP with Thonny
- input sensors: range (presence), sound, capacitance (touch), photocells
- Neopixels (light) limits
- Piezos (sound)

INSTRUMENT
- input interface: switches, knobs, buttons how many
- touch 2?
- acceleration and orientation
- laser cutting

ENTANGLERS
- networking
- Servos (movement) how?
- soldering and prototyping?

## future

design thinking? there's tons of pedagogical content around the issues I'm bringing up here that I am leaving by the wayside, or leaving to intuition.
