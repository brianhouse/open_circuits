## Reading

[Effortless Slippage](../readings/burrington_effortless_slippage.md)


## Crit (<80')

So let's take a look at the exercise. We won't formally critique this work, but let's have everyone show what they did, and I'd like everyone to have questions and comments for each other. [screenshare and show via classroom]

What commonalities and patterns emerged?
- energy usage?
- ambient vs intentionally engaged?
- layers?


## Social automation introduction

Read intro: [Project 1](../projects/1_social_automation/description.md)

Discuss Twitter next class

"There's a lot of setup with this."
Setup with APIs, send a single tweet. That's enough.


## Practicals
- Discuss presentations and sign-up
- This can be a question raised by the text, a critique of it, a link to related artistic work, or some other brief comment which can stimulate our discussion
