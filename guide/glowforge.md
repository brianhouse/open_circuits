# Laser Cutting

A laser-cut printer works by focusing light upon a surface and heating it to the point of melting or vaporization. Ours is called Beamzilla. It's pretty awesome!


## Steps

Please follow the procedure below carefully—it's important to use this machine safely and maintain it for use by all the students in the class.

### Prepare the machine
1. Turn on the Glowforge (the switch is on the back of machine on the right).
1. Open the lid, and insert a piece of Draftboard.
    - The QR code of the Draftboard should be facing up when placed in the printing bed.
    - Make sure the sides of the material are pressed down so they are flush with the side rails.
1. If you are using a fresh piece of Draftboard, sign out a piece on the Draftboard tracking sheet.  
1. Double-check that the air filter and laser cutter are securely connected with the tubing.

### Load your design
1. Navigate to https://app.glowforge.com and sign in.
1. Choose "Create new design" —> "Upload a file" and select the .svg file you created with [Inkscape](../vector_drawing/vector_drawing.md).
1. Make sure that:
    - "Medium Draftboard" is indicated as the material in the upper-left corner of the interface
    - Your design is positioned on a clear portion of Draftboard (do your best to minimize the use of space while keeping a small margin at the edges)
    - The layers panel indicates the appropriate function (CUT, SCORE, ENGRAVE) for each part of your design  
    (If you need to change the function, select the object, copy it, and then right-click and select "paste as a new step". It will now appear as a new step on the left tab and you may change its operation. Be sure to delete the original object.)  
1. Once you are ready, click "Print".
1. Look at the time estimate: if this is longer than 20 minutes or so, consider modifying your design.

### Begin cutting
1. **Turn on the filter.**
1. Press the pulsing white button on the machine.
1. Do not leave the laser cutter unattended under any circumstances. If you must leave the laser cutter press the glowing button on the top of the machine to pause the print. 
1. In the event of a fire follow the following instructions:
    - Turn off and/or unplug the machine
    - Extinguish the fire if trained to do so
    - Close the door to contain the fire
    - Call ACPD (413-542-2111)
    - Alert people in the area and evacuate the area

### Finish up
1. When the machine is done, wait until the button light turns off before opening the machine.
1. Leave the filter on while opening the lid.
1. Remove your Draftboard, the design, and clear all scraps (scraps can go in the scrap box).
1. Close the lid and turn off the filter.
1. Write your name on the leftover Draftboard and leave it for future use.
1. Once your print is finished and cooled off gently remove and peel off the protective paper from both sides.
