## Creation

Understand what you are planning on creating. You should know the answers to these questions: What are you making? How big will it be? What parts will be cut/engraved/scored?

Click the `View Objects` button in the top dashboard. A tab will pop open to the right, click the `Add Layer` button and 3 layers. Name one layer cut, one engrave, and one score. When working on your project be sure to be conscious of which layer you are working on to make sure that all engraved, cut, and scored objects are on their respective layer.
Begin creating!

## Formatting
Once you have finished your drawing: Go to your Cut layer. Select all objects on this layer only: press Ctrl+ A (Win) or Command+ A (Mac). Click the `Fill and Stroke button`. A tab will pop open to the right, click `Fill` then click the X (`no paint`) under `Fill` so the objects become "hollow", this ensures that Beamzilla only cuts the perimeter of the objects. Next, click `Stroke Paint` and then the solid blue square, `Flat color`. Next, click `Stroke Style` and change the width unit to inches `in`. and change the width to 0.001. DON'T WORRY your work didn't just disappear it's still there the outline is just super thin!

If you want your engraved objects to be engraved as a filled solid shape: Go to your Engrave layer. Select all objects on this layer only: press Ctrl+ A (Win) or Command+ A (Mac). Click the `Fill and Stroke` button. A tab will pop open to the right, click `Fill` then the solid blue square, `Flat color` (you can do any color). Next, click `Stroke Paint` and then the solid blue square, `Flat color`. Next, click `Stroke Style` and change the width unit to inches `in`. and change the width to 0.001. Repeat for your Score layer.

If you want any objects on your engrave or score layer to be engraved/scored as lines rather than solid fill: Go to the respective layer (engrave or score). Select all the objects you wish to be made lines. Click the `Fill and Stroke` button. A tab will pop open to the right, click `Fill` then click the X (no paint). Next, click `Stroke Paint` and then the solid blue square, Flat color. Next, click `Stroke Style` and change the width unit to inches in. and change the width to 0.001

Select all objects on all layers: press Ctrl+Alt+A (Win) or Command+Option+A (Mac). Then click `Path`, then `Object to Path`. (Beamzilla can only read Paths so all objects must be converted)

Once you have completed all these steps you are ready to save your file! Go to `File>Save as`, save the file as an "Inkscape SVG (*.svg)"

_You are now ready for Beamzilla!_
