# Inkscape
 
Inkscape is a free vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. You can download Inkscape [here](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.2.2/).

<!-- A video tutorial can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h6DkFrqTs8azBbxr2fY-hahtvEaqBuQK/view?usp=drive_link), which you can follow as you read the instructions. -->


## Set Up

1. Download [GlowforgeTemplate.svg](cuts/GlowforgeTemplate.svg)
1. Open GlowforgeTemplate.svg using Inkscape
1. Choose `File > Save Template...`, call it "Glowforge Template" and make sure `Set as default template` is checked
1. Close the file
1. Select `File > New` â€” you should see a light orange grid


## Configuration and Creation

For our purposes, we will primarily be using the "Pen Tool", which you can select from the menu on the left.

Make a shape by clicking to define its vertices and then close it by clicking where you started.

While the shape you just created is highlighted, choose `Object > Fill and Stroke...`. Under the sub-panel `Fill` choose the `X` for no fill. Under `Stroke style`, set your line width to 0.010. Keep these settings for everything that you do.

Make note of the "snapping" menu in the upper-right corner, which will be helpful when you want your drawing to conform to the grid (or not). 

Use + (actually =) and - on your keyboard to zoom in and out.
