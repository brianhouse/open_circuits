# Introduction

Hi everyone, welcome to Open Circuits.

Intros:
- name + pronouns
- art courses at Amherst
- experience with programming
- experience with electronics

(second semester, sound artist, experienced programmer, novice with electronics)


### What this course is not

- It's not a science or engineering course

We will not be learning the mathematics of circuitry or general engineering priciples. It's not about understanding electricity. There are no formulas. 


### What this course is

#### This is a studio art course

What happens in an artist's studio?
- experimentation
- exploration
- tinkering with materials
- self-expression
- creative misuse
- wrestle with social issues through making
- goal: to produce something aesthetically beautiful and/or interesting


This space: has been the artist-in-residence studio on campus, and now it's the Sound + Electronics studio. Just cleaned it out last week. 

...and this course is a brand new course. Never been taught.

So you all are the guinea pigs, and we're going to be figuring some stuff out together.


#### Media art

In this course, we are going to be building circuits using microcontrollers. And we'll dive in to the specifics soon enough. 

But to situate it further, we're loosely in the genre of media art. Which is art that not only uses technology, but also reflects on technology and our relationship to it.

How is it working? How do you feel about it aesthetically? What's the concept?
