#### PROJECTS
- responsive object (sensor + output) [no network]
- instrument (accelerometers + buttons + lights + streaming data) [what is it on the software side? use dedicated router]
/
- drawing machines!


#### GUIDE
- section on breadboards and power rails
- pulsesensor code
- separate code into posting and streaming
- more inputs? more outputs?
- generalize away from AIO in the sections
- more sound, with amps (https://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/sound/01-intro/)
- touch vs force is weird nomenclature; capacitance is undersold
- have project examples for every sensor, or at least a list of the type of things they might detect (or do, in the case of outputs)


#### MATERIAL

get: toggles, good 10k potentiometers + caps
red, black, and green wires

### CONCEPT

really cybernetics
esparza got me excited about this course

have them present artists AND readings to lead discussion

emergence, autonomy
more robots





open signal

feather audio playback
have to have a situated sound assignment
sensor triggered

this has to directly lead into a sound course as much as possible
