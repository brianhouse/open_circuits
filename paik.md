Intro: name + pronouns, YEAR, MAJOR


## Paik
Does anyone know something about Nam June Paik?

- first video artist
- came out of Fluxus, a conceptual art movement, and worked with John Cage (4'33")
Pasteur?

- inoculation to stimulate immunity
Robespierre?
- violent revolution
- "The medium is the message" -- the medium itself is what transforms society more than what is said through it (1964)
Cybernetics?
- "the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine" (1948)
- systems that incorporate human and non-human elements, ie computers
- the idea that you can define the world as a system
- what is that?
Happenings?
- Alan Kaprow, social interaction can itself be an artistic work
- Paik is explicitly making the happening technological, saying that art also applies to those systems
- this is one origin point of media art
Grid?
- he's describing a transistor: an electronic switch, which makes it process for machines to process information
- I think he's confused here, however
- Transistor was at Bell Labs (1947), or the vacuum tube at the turn of the 20th century by Sir John Ambrose Fleming, an Englishman
Buddhism and 'third way?'
- between aceticism and indulgence
Karma
- interconnectedness and cause and effect
- samsara? contined cycle of existence
Metempsychosis?
- reincarnation

So, in summary, he's saying technology is inseparable from contemporary existence, and thus a necessary domain of art
