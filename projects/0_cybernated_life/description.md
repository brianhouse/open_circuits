# Project #0: Cybernated Life

In 1964, Nam June Paik called for a "cybernated art" that would address the (new?) experience of "cybernated life". He looked upon (pre-)digital technology as a pervasive and potentially destabilizing force.

In 2022, we live in a world where much of our lives are, arguably, cybernated. In this short project, you will investigate the extent to which this is the case in your own day-to-day experience. This can serve as a starting place or resource for your later artistic work.

For a 24-hour period, catalog every interaction you have that is mediated by electronically encoded information. For example, this might include sending a text message to a friend, using a credit card, being recorded on a security camera, or viewing an image on a social media platform. For each interaction, note:

- the time
- the place
- what effect it had in the world

Once you have made this list, visually organize the content in some way. This might be a flow-chart, diagram, network, or map of relationships. Use whatever medium you want, such as pen and paper; you will not be evaluated on craft, but be prepared to discuss your observations about how you are situated within digital media.
