# Project #2: Poetic Sensing

As of 2020, there are [30 billion devices connected to the internet](https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/), which far exceeds the human population. Most of these devices include sensors to capture data about the physical world, whether by monitoring the environment, surveilling people, or otherwise providing input to machines. While we may be largely unaware of their presence, these sensors and the systems of which they are a part end up shaping the world around us.

For this project, you will engage with sensor systems as an artistic medium. Choose some aspect of your physical environment and use a sensor to capture itâ€”this could be as simple as how many times you sit at your desk, for example, or the amount of electromagnetic interference you pass during the day. These data will be transmitted to a server. Subsequently, you will interpret the data in some way using Processing.

To capture data, you will use a [ESP32 wireless microcontroller](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) and the [Adafruit IO platform](https://io.adafruit.com). You can use Python for Processing to interpret the data, or some other platform if you prefer.

This is a 3-week project. Next week you will present a proposal of your idea to the class for feedback, and you will present your progress. The following week will be a crit. You must have a title and an underlying artistic concept articulated with a [3-sentence description](../../resources/description_guidelines.md) that you will present with the work.

For your proposal, turn in a draft version of your title and description. Also include any references to fully explain your thinking.
