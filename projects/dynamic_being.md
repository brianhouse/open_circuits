# Dynamic Being

For this project, you will make an entity of some kind that transforms itself from one state to another or changes continuously.

The definition of "entity" is intentionally broad—it could be an agent or character that you personify in some way, it could be an abstract geometrical structure that goes through a process of some kind, or it could incorporate elements and representations that impart symbolic meaning. Regardless, "transformation" should be a central part of your concept, whether that is literal or metaphorical.

From a technical standpoint, you must use the ESP32 and servo motors in some way. The laser cutter may be very useful to build parts to house and move in response to the servos (although it is not required to use it). You may also incorporate sensors, lights, and piezos as your concept demands. It does not have to work solely off of battery power, but it can if desired (using AA battery packs for the servos).

## Proposal

Your proposal should be a Google Slides / Keynote / PowerPoint presentation that consists of:
- An explanation of the concept you want to explore
- Three artistic precedents that we've seen in class or that you've independently researched
- Your idea
- The technical approach you are planning on taking
- What materials you are planning on using (and if there are requests for materials to be ordered)
- Questions for the class regarding your idea or its execution

Turn in your proposal on Moodle and be prepared to talk about it in class.


## Deliverables

In addition to presenting your object itself for critique, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short documentation video. These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.

Your video should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape**, [use AE/AF Lock](https://improvephotography.com/53127/what-is-ae-af-lock-on-an-iphone-and-how-does-that-help-my-pictures/), and use a tripod (tripods are available in 303). You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—visually tell the story of how your piece is working.
