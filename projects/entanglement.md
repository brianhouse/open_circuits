# Entanglement

For this project, you will build two entities that communicate with one another and move in response.

Using the wifi capability of two ESP32s, your entities will exchange messages. These messages could consist of data from sensors (the environment), information about internal states (thoughts?), intentions, or anything else that can be expressed in a small amount of transmittable data.

Each entity will respond to the messages of the other by moving via servomechanical motors. This might be spatial motion with wheels, or maybe an arm that opens or closes a container, orifice, or door of some kind, or any other simple motion that has a visual impact.

Conceptually, your project should address themes of social dynamics in some way, such as collaboration or competition, language, mimickry, etc.


## Proposal

Your proposal should be a Google Slides / Keynote / PowerPoint presentation that consists of:
- An explanation of the concept you want to explore
- Three artistic precedents that we've seen in class or that you've independently researched
- Your idea
- The technical approach you are planning on taking
- What materials you are planning on using
- Questions for the class regarding your idea or its execution

Turn in your proposal on Moodle and be prepared to talk about it in class.


## Documentation

In addition to presenting your entangled pair during critique, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short documentation video. These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.

Your video should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape** and use a tripod (tripods are available in 303). You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—visually tell the story of how your entities are interacting.
