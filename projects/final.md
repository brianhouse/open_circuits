# Final Project

Your final project is one of your own design. You may use any of the methods that we have learned throughout the semester and explore any of the concepts that have arisen in the course of the class, subject to approval by the professor.

Keep in mind the short timeframe, and plan your work accordingly.

## Proposal

Your proposal should be a Google Slides / Keynote / PowerPoint presentation that consists of:
- An explanation of the concept you want to explore
- Three artistic precedents that we've seen in class or that you've independently researched
- Your idea
- The technical approach you are planning on taking
- What materials you are planning on using
- Questions for the class regarding your idea or its execution

Turn in your proposal on Moodle and be prepared to talk about it in class.


## Documentation

In addition to presenting your work for critique, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short documentation video. These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.

Your video should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape**, [use AE/AF Lock](https://improvephotography.com/53127/what-is-ae-af-lock-on-an-iphone-and-how-does-that-help-my-pictures/), and use a tripod (tripods are available in 303). You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—visually tell the story of you work.
