# Instrument

For this project, you will make an instrument that you will use to perform.

"Instrument" is loosely defined. It can be musical in a traditional sense, or it can just make abstract noise. Or it might not make noise at all—its output might be lights.

The key point is that you will control the instrument with your body. This means it needs an interface of some kind. You might use sensors, such as range or light, but you can also use toggles, buttons, and knobs to make something that operates like something familiar from electronic music. You might also use an IMU to make your instrument respond to being moved around.

Regardless, your instrument should have a physical form. You can build this using the laser cutter or with traditional tools and whatever material you can find. Your instrument might sit on a table, it might be held, or it might be mounted directly on your body.

How you design the relationship between the interface and the output is most important.


## Proposal

Your proposal should be a Google Slides / Keynote / PowerPoint presentation that consists of:
- An explanation of the concept you want to explore
- Three artistic precedents that we've seen in class or that you've independently researched
- Your idea
- The technical approach you are planning on taking
- What materials you are planning on using

Turn in your proposal on Moodle and be prepared to talk about it in class.


## Documentation

In addition to demoing your instrument during critique, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short documentation video. These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.

Your video should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape** and use a tripod (tripods are available in 303). You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—your performance should demonstrate the capabilities of your instrument (and include close-up shots of its interface).
