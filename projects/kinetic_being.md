# Kinetic Being

This time, you will make a sculpture that expresses itself through movement.

Your sculpture should be built largely from scratch and make use of the laser cutter. It should incorporate at least one servo, and it may also make use of light and sound. It should operate independent of a computer, but it will have to be plugged in. **The electronics should be integrated in the object—we should not see the microcontroller.**

Your sculpture should express itself as a "being" through the way that it moves, whether that means it has identifiable body parts or just abstract motion.


## Proposal

Your proposal should be a PDF document that consists of:
- An explanation of the concept you want to explore
- Three artistic precedents that we've seen in class or that you've independently researched
- Your idea
- The technical approach you are planning on taking
- What materials you are planning on using
- Questions for the class regarding your idea or its execution

Turn in your proposal on Moodle under the section for this project and be prepared to talk about it in class.


## Deliverables

In addition to presenting your object itself for critique, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short documentation video. These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.

Your video should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape**, [use AE/AF Lock](https://improvephotography.com/53127/what-is-ae-af-lock-on-an-iphone-and-how-does-that-help-my-pictures/), and use the photography studio in the back of 303. You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—tell the story of your being visually.
