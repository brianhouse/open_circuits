# Responsive Object

For this project, you will make an object of some kind that responds to its environment.

The definition of "object" is open to interpretation—it could be an abstract sculpture that you build from scratch, a household item that you modify, a character or figure, or something that lives outside in a nonhuman context. Regardless, it must be stationary and designed for a specific place.

To "respond" is to use a microntroller to take input from one or more sensors (range/presence, sound level, light level, capacitance) and transform the data into light or sound (via Neopixels and/or piezos, with the possibility of an amplifier and speakers). It should battery powered and operate without manual intervention (other than using the capacitive sensors).

The way that your object responds to its environment should not only be aesthetically interesting, it should have a conceptual or poetic purpose. For example, an object that lights up when it gets dark outside might be functional, but why does it do this? Is it scared of the dark? Is it a comment on humans' disrespect of diural cycles? Does it create patterns that remind you of cars passing on the street when you were young? In other words, how can you utilize a simple relationship between input and output to express something about the world?

## Proposal

Your proposal should be a Google Slides / Keynote / PowerPoint presentation that consists of:
- An explanation of the concept you want to explore
- Three artistic precedents that we've seen in class or that you've independently researched
- Your idea
- The technical approach you are planning on taking
- What materials you are planning on using

Turn in your proposal on Moodle and be prepared to talk about it in class.


## Deliverables

In addition to presenting your object itself for critique, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short documentation video. These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.

Your video should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape** and use a tripod (tripods are available in 303). You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—visually tell the story of how your object is working.
