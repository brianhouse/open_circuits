# Telepresence

For this project, you will make an interface that remotely controls an instrument. 

"Interface" means some combination of sensors, buttons, knobs, switches, and/or an IMU that you control in some way with your body. 

"Instrument" is loosely defined. It can be musical in a traditional sense, or kinetic using servos, or a light show, or a robot...

The key point is that you will remotely control some mechanism that is experienced by an audience. How you design the relationship between the interface and the output is most important—what you design should be conceptually motivated.


## Proposal

Your proposal should be a Google Slides / Keynote / PowerPoint presentation that consists of:
- An explanation of the concept you want to explore
- Three artistic precedents that we've seen in class or that you've independently researched
- Your idea
- The technical approach you are planning on taking
- What materials you are planning on using
- Questions for the class regarding your idea or its execution

Turn in your proposal on Moodle and be prepared to talk about it in class.


## Documentation

In addition to demoing your instrument during critique, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short documentation video. These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.

Your video should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape**, [use AE/AF Lock](https://improvephotography.com/53127/what-is-ae-af-lock-on-an-iphone-and-how-does-that-help-my-pictures/), and use the photography studio in the back of 303. You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—your performance should demonstrate the capabilities of your instrument (and include close-up shots of its interface).
