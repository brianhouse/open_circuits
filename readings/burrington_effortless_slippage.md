# Ingrid Burrington, Effortless Slippage

snark
[Caelan: tone]

"Effortless Slippage"—what is this? specifically that the map appears seamless
- hides its infrastructure
- hides its ideology [Facebook wants you to think that social ties are the same things as friends]

Talking about maps, but this is valid for all platforms

a bot is a grey area

Media Archeology as a mode—look at alternative ways things were understood in past that didn't become dominant / normalized


Burrington makes an argument for adding friction (which is also present in Paglen) -- how do we feel about this?
