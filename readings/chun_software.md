# Wendy Chun, On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge

Professor at Simon Fraser in Vancouver, previously at Brown

address the flip/flop "master"/"slave"


Wendy:
"software is a functional analog to ideology"

"In a formal sense computers understood as comprising software and hardware are ideology machines."


well, what's visual about it?

Marx's dialectical materialism—the actual stuff of the world that define the power relations (control the means of production, etc)

Althusser’s definition of ideology as “a ‘representation’ of the imaginary relation of individuals to their real conditions of existence" ["imaginary" ties to Lacan, no?]

[hailing example -> false consciousness]

the hardware is the material reality, in the Marxist sense
the "software" which is very slippery on all its nested levels, is ideology

Software produces/hails “users.”

software is imaginary
it imposes subject positions on us

computer science takes certain relationships as a given—ahistorical

theory historicizes them, puts them in context

artists are precisely (re-)examining the relationships and imagining new ones
