A dutch media arts critic

a pretty bold essay, in an understated way, taking on analog vs digital, post-modernism, hipsterism, and systems theory kind of all at once

he wants to get precise about what is at stake with the digital
- so we're clear, how is a typewriter digital?
--> discrete logic and an emphasis on the symbolic, rather than the material (from "codes to traces" (19)

that opens the possibility for something that is conceptually or aesthetically analog, even if it involves electronic computers (which is a little bit what Kim Cascone was getting at with glitch)


so how does he feel about type-writer guy?

and as he says (16) post-digital attitudes "dismiss the idea of digital processing as the sole universal all-purpose form of information processing" --> he favors this, while this critique is more or less against reactionary analog purists (as well as oppressive digital power)

makes the point that the whole way information circulates, how discourse works now is "post-digital"


ties in a bit to Sam and Elias's discussion from last time:
- post as in a linear progression out of the prior thing
- post as an expansion of the original thing, or life after the original things moment


at the end, he loops back to cybernetics and systems with the paik. we're still thinking about things in terms of systems

how might systems be inadequate to describe our world?
--> Ive been thinking a lot about anxiety in this. hope is something other than prediction.
